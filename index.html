                        The quality of democratic governance in the United States is deteriorating. A healthy democracy 
                        requires a healthy information ecosystem. Like termites eating away at the foundations of a house, 
                        the electronic amplification of lies and misinformation is stealthily eroding the foundations of American 
                        democracy. Congress must act now to address the problem before it is too late. The National Endowment 
                        for Fact-Checking Act will help preserve the integrity of American democracy by reducing the electronic 
                        amplification of false and misleading claims related to elections and public health. The Act is entirely
                        consistent with the First Amendment because it relies on private companies, not government sanctions, 
                        to de-amplify habitual liars.

                                    In my early career, I worked for the federal government on nuclear proliferation and
                                    nuclear arms
                                    control issues because I feared that nuclear weapons posed a threat to humanity and

                                    wanted to help
                                    mitigate that threat. For the past few years, I have devoted much of my time as a
                                    scholar to
                                    the problem of disinformation. Today, I fear that traditional tools of
                                    disinformation,
                                    combined with modern technologies for electronic amplification, pose a significant

                                    democracy in the United States and elsewhere. I drafted the National Endowment for

                                    to help mitigate that threat. I hope you agree that my proposed

                                    would help

                        The Act delegates certain tasks to a new, non-partisan, non-governmental organization called
                        the National Endowment for Fact-Checking (NEFC). NEFC would distribute federal funds to existing
                        fact-checking organizations to enhance their effectiveness and efficiency. NEFC would provide
                        quarterly reports to Congress and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to shine the light
                        of truth on persistent offenders. NEFC's reports would identify individuals with large electronic
                        megaphones who repeatedly disseminate false and misleading claims about elections and public
                        health after receiving warnings not to do so. NEFC's reports would also identify companies that
                        continue to amplify the voices of persistent offenders after receiving recommendations to
                        de-amplify them. The statutory scheme nudges companies to de-amplify persistent offenders, but
                        does not compel them to do so. It also provides incentives for habitual liars to tell the truth,
                        or risk losing their access to large electronic megaphones.

                        <p class="overview-para">
                            The statute regulates private companies that provide electronic amplification services for
                            individuals. Under the statute, those companies are known as “electronic megaphone
                            companies,” or “EMCs.” Empirical studies show that the interaction among different types of
                            technologies facilitates the rapid dissemination of misinformation to large audiences. Therefore,
                            the statutory definition of EMCs includes companies that provide electronic amplification
                            services for messages transmitted via radio, television, social media, blogs, and podcasts. </p>
                        <p class="overview-para">
                            The statute also regulates “persons with large electronic megaphones,” or PLEMs. The
                            statutory definition of PLEMs includes numerical thresholds; individuals whose electronic reach
                            falls below those thresholds are exempt from regulation. Empirical research demonstrates that a
                            small number of individuals—persons with large electronic megaphones—are responsible for the
                            vast majority of the harm caused by electronic amplification of misinformation related to
                            elections and public health. Under the statute, independent fact-checking organizations would
                            issue warnings to PLEMs who disseminate false or misleading claims related to elections or
                            public health. If individual PLEMs ignore those warnings, NEFC would encourage (but not
                            require) EMCs to de-amplify them. PLEMs who heed warnings and refrain from spreading
                            false/misleading claims would retain unrestricted freedom of reach.

                        Any system to reduce electronic amplification of false/misleading claims requires some
                        entity or entities to decide, on a case-by-case basis, whether a particular claim is true or false.
                        Empirical evidence demonstrates that individuals are not very good at making those judgments
                        for themselves. We cannot trust private companies to discriminate reliably between true and false
                        claims because a system entrusting that responsibility to private companies grants too much
                        power to a small number of large, private companies. The First Amendment bars Congress from
                        delegating to any government agency or official the primary responsibility for making case-by-
                        case decisions about which claims are true and false. Accordingly, the statute delegates that
                        responsibility to independent fact-checking organizations.

                        The statute acknowledges that NEFC has been incorporated as a private, nonprofit
                        corporation under the laws of the District of Columbia. The statute states explicitly that NEFC
                        “is not an agency or establishment of the United States Government.” Under the statute, NEFC’s
                        primary responsibilities are to:

                            </li>
                            <li>Provide detailed, quarterly reports to Congress, the FCC, and the public at large. NEFC’s

                                those PLEMs after receiving recommendations to de-amplify them.

                    <p class="overview-para">The statute creates two types of binding obligations for EMCs. They must prepare

                        qualify as PLEMs under the statutory definition. They must also pay fees assessed by the FCC to
                        fund implementation of the statute. The statute authorizes the FCC to impose penalties on EMCs
                        who fail to pay the statutory fees or fail to file the mandatory reports. The statute does not grant
                        the FCC authority to impose penalties on EMCs that continue to amplify PLEMs after receiving
                        recommendations to de-amplify them (although the FCC may have such authority under existing
                        law). The statute grants the FCC authority to promulgate regulations to promote effective
                        implementation of the law.</p>

                    <b>What Would the Statute Accomplish?</b>
                    <p class="overview-para">By providing federal funding, the statute would enable existing fact-checking
                        organizations to perform their missions more effectively and efficiently. The overall statutory
                        scheme—including warnings to PLEMs who disseminate false/misleading claims,
                        recommendations to EMCs to de-amplify PLEMs who ignore such warnings, and regular reports
                        to Congress and the FCC to “name and shame” EMCs who refuse to follow such
                        recommendations—will reduce the electronic amplification of misinformation related to
                        elections and public health. The statute provides incentives for PLEMs to tell the truth, or risk
                        losing their ability to reach large audiences via electronic megaphones. It also encourages EMCs
                        to de-amplify PLEMs who ignore repeated warnings, or risk reputational harm that could affect
                        their profitability.</p>
                    <p class="overview-para">The statute does not impose civil or criminal penalties on PLEMs who persistently
                        disseminate false or misleading claims, nor does it impose penalties (other than reputational
                        harm) on EMCs who continue to amplify those PLEMs. Hence, skeptics may wonder whether
                        the statute would actually reduce electronic amplification of misinformation. In fact, the absence
                        of civil or criminal sanctions is a feature, not a bug. The lack of such penalties is a key feature
                        that will help the statute survive constitutional scrutiny under the First Amendment.</p>
                    <p class="overview-para">NEFC’s reports to Congress will provide a factual basis for Congress to determine—after
                        the law has been implemented for a few years—whether a statutory scheme that relies primarily
                        on “nudging” provides a sufficiently strong remedy to protect American democracy. Congress
                        might ultimately decide, based on NEFC’s reporting, that civil and/or criminal penalties are
                        necessary to protect our democracy from the danger posed by electronic amplification of
                        misinformation. In that case, an amended statute including such penalties would be much more
                        likely to survive a First Amendment challenge because the government could argue that it tried
                        less restrictive means (i.e., nudging), but those less restrictive means did not achieve a
                        sufficiently large reduction in the electronic amplification of lies and misinformation related to
                        elections and public health.</p>

                The attached paper analyzes three potential claims that could be raised
                to challenge the constitutional validity of the proposed National Endowment for Fact-Checking
                Act. The first one involves claims by “electronic megaphone companies” (EMCs).
                The next two involve claims by “persons with large electronic megaphones” (PLEMs).
                For the reasons explained in the attached paper,
                I conclude that the potential claims by PLEMs would almost certainly fail.
                The outcome of a First Amendment claim by EMCs is more difficult to predict,
                but the proposed statute, if enacted, would likely survive constitutional scrutiny.

                    <li class="endorse-li">It would help protect American democracy from the threat
